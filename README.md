## About
* Provides an interactive way for users to administer a school database by displaying courses, viewing details, as well as creating, updating, and deleting existing courses.
* Includes a simple UI using the React framework, which makes use of its Context API for state management.
* Comes equipped with authentication, authorization, form validation, and persistent data storage. All of which make use of the Express framework, and a REST API built from scratch.
